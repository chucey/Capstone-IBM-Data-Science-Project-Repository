# Capstone-IBM-Data-Science-Project-Repository
This repository highlights the work completed as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.

This project reuired me to pretend to be a data scientist who is working for a corporate competitor to SpaceX with the goal of launching rockets as cheaply as posiible. To do this, I was tasked with building a machine learning model that could predict successful rocket landings after launch. If I can predict a successful landing, I can then determine the cost of launching a rocket with a successful landing.

To begin, I gathered data of past SpaceX rocket launches via webscaping. Gathered data included:
* launch site of each rocket
* mass of each rocket's payload
* type of booster rocket used
* type of landing (successful or failed)
* etc
